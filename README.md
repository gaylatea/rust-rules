# Rust Rules
This repo provides Rust build rules for the [Please](https://please.build) build system.

## Basic usage
First add the plugin to your project. In `plugins/BUILD`:
```python
plugin_repo(
    name = "rust",
    owner = "becomeliminal",
    revision = "<Some git tag, commit, or other reference>",
)
```

Set up the Rust toolchain for your project in `third_party/rust`:
```python
subinclude("///rust//build_defs:rust")

rust_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    hashes = ["<hash>"],
    version = "X.XX.X",
    visibility = ["PUBLIC"],
)
```

The toolchain is downloaded for the machine doing the building, so a repo
worked on from both linux and macOS lists a hash per platform and plz
accepts whichever matches.

Then add the plugin config to `.plzconfig`:
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
Target = //plugins:rust
```

You can then compile and test Rust libraries like so:
```python
subinclude("///rust//build_defs:rust")

rust_library(
    name = "lib",
    root = "src/lib.rs",
    modules = [
        "src/module_a.rs",
        "src/module_a/sub_module_a.rs",
        "src/module_b.rs",
        "src/module_b/sub_module_b.rs",
    ],
)

rust_test(
    name = "lib",
    root = "src/lib.rs",
    modules = [
        "src/module_a.rs",
        "src/module_a/sub_module_a.rs",
        "src/module_b.rs",
        "src/module_b/sub_module_b.rs",
    ],
)
```
Tests report individual results to Please (not just pass/fail). Integration
tests are `rust_test` rules rooted at a file under `tests/`, depending on the
library; documentation tests run with `rust_doc_test`:
```python
rust_test(
    name = "integration_test",
    root = "tests/integration_test.rs",
    deps = [":lib"],
)

rust_doc_test(
    name = "doc_test",
    crate_name = "lib",
    root = "src/lib.rs",
    deps = [":lib"],
)
```

You can define third-party crates using `rust_repo`. Only your direct
dependencies need declaring. Versions, features and transitive dependencies
are resolved from each crate's `Cargo.toml`, the same way Cargo would:
```python
subinclude("///rust//build_defs:rust")

rust_repo(
    name = "serde",
    crate = "serde",
    version = "1.0.228",
    features = ["derive"],
)

rust_repo(
    name = "rand",
    crate = "rand",
    version = "0.8.5",
)
```

To add a dependency (and everything it needs) straight from crates.io:
```ini
plz run //tools/please_rust -- lock --add serde@1
```
Enable features, and anything they turn on is declared for you:
```ini
plz run //tools/please_rust -- lock --add serde@1 --features derive
```

To move crates to the newest version their requirements allow, which is what
`cargo update` does:
```ini
plz run //tools/please_rust -- lock --upgrade            # everything
plz run //tools/please_rust -- lock --upgrade serde      # one crate
```
A direct declaration keeps its compatibility range, so `0.4.1` reaches the
newest `0.4.x` and does not cross to `0.5`. Indirect crates move when the
crate that needs them asks for something newer. MSRV filtering still applies.

A crate can move backwards, marked `v` rather than `^`. Taking the newest of
one crate can cost another a version, because the newer release of that other
crate forbade it.

Version selection is a PubGrub solve over the crates.io index: it backtracks
rather than failing when a late requirement rules out an earlier choice, and
it respects `rust-version`, so an older `rust_toolchain` gets the newest
releases that actually support it. Already-declared versions are preferred,
so adding one crate does not churn the rest of the graph, and `--upgrade` is
how you drop that preference. `--ignore-msrv` turns MSRV filtering off;
`--greedy` selects the older non-backtracking resolver.

The toolchain filtered against is the one your `rust_toolchain` declares,
found wherever it is declared. `--toolchain-version 1.74.0` resolves for a
different one. Declaring the toolchain in a different package from the crates
is the ordinary case, and on rustc 1.74 `clap` reaches 4.5.61 rather than
4.6.6, which needs 1.85.

Filtering never turns a solvable graph into an error. When nothing that
builds on your toolchain satisfies a requirement, the newest release that
does satisfy it is taken and named, along with the rustc it needs.

Declarations are shared by everyone working in the repo, so `lock` solves
for every platform in `--targets` (linux x86_64 and both darwin arches by
default) and declares the union. A linux developer adding `chrono` declares
`core-foundation-sys` too, because `iana-time-zone` needs it on macOS, and
their colleague on a Mac can build the branch. Resolution itself is still
per-platform and happens in the build graph, so each machine builds only the
crates it actually needs.


Or import an existing Cargo project wholesale from its lockfile:
```ini
plz run //tools/please_rust -- sync --import path/to/Cargo.lock
```

To port a whole cargo workspace, point the importer at it:
```ini
plz run //tools/please_rust -- sync --import-workspace path/to/workspace
```
This writes a BUILD file next to every member (`rust_library`,
`rust_binary`, `rust_test` for unit and integration tests, with path
dependencies mapped to member labels), scaffolds `third_party/rust/BUILD`,
`.plzconfig` and `plugins/BUILD` on a fresh repo, and imports the
workspace's `Cargo.lock` for the third-party graph. Existing BUILD files
are never overwritten; build scripts, optional features and renames are
reported for manual follow-up.

Both maintain the `rust_repo` declarations in `third_party/rust/BUILD` for
you, including sha256 hashes so every download is verified. After editing
declarations by hand, run `plz run //tools/please_rust -- sync` to re-resolve.

To use a fork or an unpublished revision, fetch the crate from a git forge
at a pinned revision instead of crates.io:
```python
rust_repo(
    name = "anyhow",
    crate = "anyhow",
    version = "1.0.86",
    git_repo = "dtolnay/anyhow",
    git_revision = "1.0.86",
)
```
`git_repo` also takes a full URL, for any forge:
```python
rust_repo(
    name = "thing",
    crate = "thing",
    version = "0.3.0",
    git_repo = "https://gitlab.com/group/thing",
    git_revision = "v0.3.0",
)
```
Most forges serve `/archive/<rev>.tar.gz`, which is what github, gitea and
its forks, and sourcehut all do. GitLab serves
`/-/archive/<rev>/<project>-<rev>.tar.gz`, and is recognised by its host.
GitLab running somewhere its name does not say needs `git_forge = "gitlab"`.
A forge serving neither scheme needs `download = ...`, naming any rule that
produces the crate's source.

`sync --import` translates `git+https://` lockfile sources from any host.

`rust_library` builds an `rlib` by default; `crate_type` also supports
`proc-macro`, `dylib`, `cdylib` and `staticlib` for compiler plugins and
C-ABI artifacts.

To compile a binary, you can use `rust_binary`. Binaries statically link the
C runtime by default (like Go), producing self-contained executables; opt out
per rule with `static = False` or globally with the `DefaultStatic` config:
```python
subinclude("///rust//build_defs:rust")

rust_binary(
    name = "bin",
    main = "src/main.rs",
    deps = [
        ":lib",
        "//third_party/rust:<rust_repo_name>",
    ],
)
```

To benchmark your code with [Criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion), you can use `rust_benchmark`:
```python
subinclude("///rust//build_defs:rust")

rust_benchmark(
    name = "your_benchmark",
    main = "src/main.rs",
    deps = [
        "//your/lib/to/benchmark",
    ],
)
```

You can use criterion directly in your `src/main.rs`:
```rust
use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion, measurement::WallTime};
use fibonacci::{fibonacci};

fn benchmark_fibonacci(c: &mut Criterion<WallTime>) {
    c.bench_function("fibonacci 20", |b| b.iter(|| fibonacci(20)));
}

criterion_group!(
    name = benches;
    config = Criterion::default().with_measurement(WallTime);
    targets = benchmark_fibonacci
);
criterion_main!(benches);
```

And run the benchmark with Please:
```ini
plz run //path/to/your_benchmark -- --bench
```

FFI bindings come from `rust_bindgen`. The bindgen binary is built from
crates by `rust_repo` (declare `bindgen-cli` via `lock --add`), and libclang
comes from the host like the C compiler does (`LibclangPath` pins one):
```python
rust_bindgen(
    name = "ffi_bindings",       # generates ffi_bindings.rs
    header = "include/mylib.h",
)

rust_library(
    name = "mylib_sys",
    root = "src/lib.rs",
    modules = [":ffi_bindings"], # or use it as the root directly
)
```

The reverse, a C header generated from Rust so C can call into a
`staticlib` or `cdylib`, comes from `rust_cbindgen`. cbindgen is declared the
same way (`lock --add cbindgen`), and parses the source rather than compiling
it, so the rule needs no toolchain:
```python
rust_cbindgen(
    name = "ffi_header",         # generates ffi_header.h
    root = "src/lib.rs",         # .hpp with lang = "c++"
)

c_binary(
    name = "uses_rust",
    srcs = ["main.c"],
    hdrs = [":ffi_header"],
    deps = [":rust_ffi"],
)
```
A signature that changes on the Rust side then stops the C compiling, rather
than compiling and crashing.

Protobuf and gRPC codegen live in
[rust-proto-rules](https://github.com/becomeliminal/rust-proto-rules), a
separate plugin that pins these rules by tag and plugs into the proto
plugin's language definitions.

Clippy, rustfmt and rustdoc ship in the toolchain, with a rule each:
```python
rust_clippy(
    name = "lint",           # plz build //pkg:lint, any finding fails
    root = "src/lib.rs",
    modules = ["src/util.rs"],
    deps = [":lib_deps"],
)

rust_fmt_test(
    name = "fmt_test",       # plz test //pkg:fmt_test, fails if unformatted
    srcs = glob(["src/*.rs"]),
)

rust_doc(
    name = "docs",           # plz build //pkg:docs, rustdoc HTML
    root = "src/lib.rs",
    deps = [":lib_deps"],
)
```

## Configuration
Plugins are configured through the Plugin section like so:
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
SomeConfig = some-value
```
The available configuration options are:

`rust_toolchain` extracts the distribution once and then lifts each piece a
build actually uses into a target of its own:

```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
Rustc   = //third_party/rust:toolchain_rustc|rustc
Sysroot = //third_party/rust:toolchain_sysroot
```

`|rustdoc`, `|clippy` and `|rustfmt` sit on `toolchain_rustc` beside `|rustc`
and are derived from `Rustc` unless you set them, so most repos configure
nothing beyond the two above. `CargoTool` and `LlvmTools` name
`toolchain_cargo` and `toolchain_llvm_tools`; only the from-source bootstrap
uses the first and only `plz cover` the second, so nothing that compiles Rust
stages either.

### Cross-compilation
`plz build --arch darwin_arm64 //...` compiles for another platform.
`rust_toolchain` installs the standard library for whatever `--arch` names,
and `architectures` installs more for cross-compiling part of a repo by
hand:

```python
rust_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    version = "1.97.1",
    architectures = ["darwin_arm64"],
)
```

Build scripts, proc macros and installed binaries are compiled for the host
whatever the target is, since they run during the build; cargo splits its
unit graph the same way. Libraries need nothing further. Linking an
executable for another platform also needs a linker that targets it, which
comes from `CCTool`.

`--arch` is an os/arch pair, and some targets are not expressible as one:
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no operating system, and musl and Solana's
`sbf-solana-solana` are neither. `TargetTriple` names the triple verbatim
instead:

```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
TargetTriple = wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Set it and every compile passes that `--target`, whatever `--arch` says;
leave it empty and the triple is derived from `--arch` as before. The
standard library still has to be there. `rust_toolchain(architectures = ...)`
accepts a raw triple as readily as an os/arch pair:

```python
rust_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    version = "1.97.1",
    architectures = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"],
    std_hashes = {"wasm32-unknown-unknown": "<hash>"},
)
```

### DefaultStatic
Binaries statically link the C runtime by default, producing self-contained
executables like Go's. Set to false to default to dynamic linking; either
way `static = True/False` on a `rust_binary` overrides per rule.
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
DefaultStatic = false
```

### CCTool
Optional build label or path of a C compiler, used by crate build scripts
and as rustc's linker. Empty uses the host cc via PATH, matching the cc
plugin's default.
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
CCTool = //third_party/cc:toolchain
```

`CXX`, `AR` and `RANLIB` come from here too, found beside the C compiler --
`gcc` pairs with `g++`, `clang` with `clang++`, anything else with `c++`.

When `CCTool` is a path and no C++ compiler sits beside it, `CXX` is left
unset rather than pointed at the host's: the two would not share a C++
standard library, and they would only disagree at the final link. Crates
that compile no C++ are unaffected; one that does fails saying so. A bare
command name keeps the host convention for `CXX` as well, since both then
come from the same `PATH`.

### Tool overrides
The other tools the rules drive each take a build label. Every one defaults
to the toolchain you already configured, so a normal repo sets none of them:

```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
ClippyTool   = //third_party/rust:toolchain_rustc|clippy
RustfmtTool  = //third_party/rust:toolchain_rustc|rustfmt
BindgenTool  = //third_party/crates:bindgen_cli
CriterionDep = //third_party/crates:criterion
```

`ClippyTool` and `RustfmtTool` are entry points on the rustc component and
follow `Rustc` unless you set them, so moving the toolchain moves them too.
`BindgenTool` is the `bindgen` binary `rust_bindgen` runs. It is declared as
an ordinary crate and built by these rules. `CriterionDep` is the crate
`rust_benchmark` links against.

### LocalSubrepos
Crate downloads and BUILD generation run locally rather than on a remote
worker. Set false to run them remotely:

```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
LocalSubrepos = false
```

### PleaseRustTool
The `please_rust` binary. The default is a hash-pinned download of a
released one, per platform, the way go-rules ships `please_go`: nothing to
build, no toolchain, no cargo, and it works under remote execution. A
platform with no published binary builds the tool from source with cargo,
which needs network access.

Point it at your own build or your own pin if you would rather not depend
on the release:

```python
# third_party/rust/BUILD
remote_file(
    name = "please_rust_tool",
    url = "https://github.com/becomeliminal/rust-rules/releases/download/<tag>/please_rust-linux_amd64",
    hashes = ["<sha256 from the release>"],
    binary = True,
    visibility = ["PUBLIC"],
)
```
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
PleaseRustTool = //third_party/rust:please_rust_tool
```

### Profiles
Cargo's profile settings, mapped onto Please's build configs. The tuning
knobs apply to optimised builds (`plz build -c opt`); `DebugAssertions`
applies to both.
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
OptLevel = 3          ; 0-3, s, z
LTO = thin            ; thin, fat, off
CodegenUnits = 1
Panic = abort         ; unwind, abort
Strip = symbols       ; none, debuginfo, symbols
DebugAssertions = false
```

### BuildScriptJobs
`NUM_JOBS`, which cc-rs and cmake-rs read to decide how many C compilers to
run. It caps C compilation in `-sys` crates and nothing else. Unset it is
half the machine.
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
BuildScriptJobs = 8
```

### rust-analyzer
rust-analyzer provides code intelligence, and normally learns the crate graph
by running cargo. With no cargo to run it asks a command instead, the same way
gopls asks go-rules' package driver rather than running `go list`.

Declare `rust_project` in the **repo root** `BUILD` file:

```python
rust_project(
    name = "rust-project",
    lock = "//third_party/crates:rust_lock",
)
```

and point your editor at it, once:

```json
"rust-analyzer.workspace.discoverConfig": {
    "command": ["plz", "run", "-p", "-v", "error", "//:rust-project", "--", "--discover", "{arg}"],
    "progressLabel": "rust-rules",
    "filesToWatch": ["BUILD", ".plzconfig"]
}
```

That is the whole setup. rust-analyzer runs the command when it opens a Rust
file, and again when a `filesToWatch` file is saved. There is no list of crates
to maintain and no generated file to keep in step.

`filesToWatch` entries are file names, matched anywhere in the tree. `BUILD`
covers every build file, nested ones included. Saving one in your editor
picks up a crate added in any directory.

rust-analyzer refreshes on a save from the editor, not on a change to the file
on disk. A build file edited outside the editor needs
`rust-analyzer: Reload Workspace`.

It finds every `rust_library`, `rust_binary` and `rust_test` in the repo and
joins them to the third-party crates in the lock. Anything the project points
at is built first.

**Your editor also needs the rust-analyzer extension installed.** Nothing warns
you if it is missing; the setting is simply ignored. VS Code and Cursor:

```sh
code --install-extension rust-lang.rust-analyzer     # or: cursor --install-...
```

Neovim, Helix and Emacs' `lsp-mode`/`eglot` take the same setting through their
own LSP configuration.

#### Without an editor
The same target writes a file, which is what CI wants and what to reach for
when debugging:

```sh
plz run //:rust-project        # writes rust-project.json at the repo root
```

The paths inside are repo-relative, so the file is identical on every machine
and belongs at the repo root. That is also the directory the editor must
open.

#### Crates in subrepos
Crates in a subrepo are described too. Plugin subrepos need no naming, since
plz already lists them. Anything brought in another way is named:

```python
rust_project(
    name = "rust-project",
    lock = "//third_party/crates:rust_lock",
    subrepos = ["shared_rust"],
)
```

They are **described but never checked on save**. A subrepo is checked in its
own repo.

Sweeping a subrepo can hit packages that will not parse from here: one that
references a plugin this repo does not have, or one that declares a plugin
this repo also declares, since plugin names are a single global namespace.
Neither loses the rest of the subrepo. The sweep descends and skips only the
packages that fail, naming each. Third-party crates never go through this at
all; they come from the lock, which already records where their sources
landed.

#### One project, or one repo of many
The default covers the whole repo, which is what a repo that *is* a Rust
project wants. A monorepo with Rust in one subtree can narrow the search, and
leave out anything that would only add noise:

```python
rust_project(
    name = "rust-project",
    lock = "//third_party/crates:rust_lock",
    targets = ["//services/...", "//libs/rust/..."],
    exclude = ["//services/legacy/"],
)
```

`targets` is where to look; `exclude` drops labels by prefix. A monorepo can
also declare several of these, one per subtree, each with its own `out`. Only
the file at the repo root is the one an editor will find.

A repo that declares third-party crates in more than one place passes every
lock:

```python
rust_project(
    name = "rust-project",
    lock = [
        "//third_party/crates:rust_lock",
        "//services/payments/third_party:payments_lock",
    ],
)
```

Each lock's crates are found under the package that declares them. A crate
depending on a lock that was left out is reported by name.

#### When something does not resolve
- **A third-party crate's imports do not resolve.** Its declaration is in a
  lock this project file was not given. The run names the crate and the
  dependency. Add that `rust_resolve` target to `lock`.
- **A crate's `#[cfg(...)]` items look inactive.** Build-script cfgs come from
  what the build has produced. It corrects itself as you build.
- **Nothing resolves, including `std`.** Set `rust_toolchain(src_hash = ...)`
  to fetch the `rust-src` component.
- **It worked, then stopped.** Run *rust-analyzer: Restart Server*.

[docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) covers the rest.

`examples/ide` is a working example of the whole thing.

### PipelinedCompilation
Splits each library crate into a metadata-only compile that dependents'
compiles hang off and a full compile that runs in parallel (the scheme
cargo and rules_rust use). Dependency chains build at frontend depth
instead of full-compile depth; the cost is that the compiler frontend runs
twice per crate. Off by default.
```ini
[Plugin "rust"]
PipelinedCompilation = true
```

### Coverage
`plz cover` works out of the box: tests are compiled with
`-C instrument-coverage` and the profiles are converted per-file line
coverage via the toolchain's bundled llvm tools (the `LlvmTools` option
overrides where those come from). The one thing a consuming repo must add is
`.rs` to Please's coverage extension list, which doesn't include it by
default:
```ini
[cover]
FileExtension = .rs
```

## General notes
Measured against cargo building the identical project with the identical
rustc, plz builds cold 1.39x faster and caches test results cargo always
re-runs; cargo keeps a decisive edge on single-crate edit loops.
The full numbers, methodology and honest caveats are in
[docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md), reproducible via
`scripts/benchmark.sh`.

[docs/COMPARISON.md](docs/COMPARISON.md) sets every feature against Bazel's
rules_rust and against Cargo, marked supported, partial or not supported, with
an issue linked for each gap.

Hit a confusing failure? [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
lists the real messages this plugin produces, what causes each, and what to
do about it.

Rust Rules replicates Cargo's build contract without ever invoking Cargo:
crate tarballs are fetched as verified downloads, `Cargo.toml` files are
parsed to infer dependencies, features, editions and build scripts, and
resolution happens deterministically inside the build graph. See
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for how this works internally.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open or submit a pull request with your changes. Ensure that your code follows the existing style and includes tests where applicable.

### Extra Features for Contribution
Here are some extra features that would be valuable additions to this project:

- **Target (OS and Architecture) Compatibility**: built and tested in CI on
  x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu and aarch64-apple-darwin, and cross-compiled from
  the former to the latter. Intel Macs, ARM linux and Windows have nobody
  running them; ARM linux is covered by resolution but not by a build.

C toolchains stay host-provided by convention (the `CCTool` config accepts
a build label for anyone who wants their own), and private registries are
on-demand: crates.io plus git forks and `download=` overrides cover the
common cases.
